There are three types of documents:

- **Factura Electronica**: This is the regular type of document and its applicable for Invoices,
  Credit Notes and Debit Notes.
- **Factura de Importaci√≥n**: This should be selected for importation transactions.
- **Factura de contingencia**: This is an exceptional type that is used as a manual backup in case
  that the company is not able to use the ERP and it's necessary to generate the invoice manually,
  when this invoice is added to the ERP, this invoice type should be selected.

Invoice validation
------------------

After the invoice is validated, an XML file is created and sent automatically to Carvajal. This
file is displayed in the chatter.

An extra field is now displayed in "Other Info" tab with the name of the XML file. Additionally
there is a second extra field that is displayed with the Electronic Invoice status, with the
initial value "In progress":

Reception of legal XML and PDF
------------------------------

The electronic invoice vendor receives the XML file and proceeds to validate the structure and the
information in it, if everything is correct the invoice status changes to "Validated" after using
the "Check Carvajal Status" button in the Action dropdown. They then proceed to generate a Legal
XML which includes a digital signature and a unique code (CUFE), a PDF invoice that includes a QR
code and the CUFE is also generated.

After this:

- A ZIP containing the legal XML and the PDF is downloaded and displayed in the invoice chatter:

Common errors
-------------

During the XML validation the most common errors are usually related to missing master data. In
such cases, error messages are shown in the chatter after updating the electronic invoice status.
