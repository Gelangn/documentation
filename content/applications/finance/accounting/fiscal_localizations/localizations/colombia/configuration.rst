.. tip::
   When the document type is RUT the identification number needs to be configured in Odoo
   including the verification digit, Odoo will split this number when the data to the third party
   vendor is sent.

Fiscal structure (RUT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The partner's responsibility codes (section 53 in the RUT document) are included as part of the
electronic invoice module given that is part of the information required by the DIAN.

These fields can be found in :menuselection:`Partner --> Sales & Purchase Tab --> Fiscal
Information`.

Taxes
-----

If your sales transactions include products with taxes, it's important to consider that an extra
field *Value Type* needs to be configured per tax. This option is located in the
:guilabel:`Advanced Options tab`.
